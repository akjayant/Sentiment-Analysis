# Sentiment-Analysis
 	Sentiment analysis on hackerearth predict happiness challenge 
 accuracy - 88.592% 
 Model - Ensemble of Random Forest, Gradient Boost, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes
 
 	Real Time Twitter Sentiment Analysis
  So I pickled the models created by hackerearth competition and used it for making predictions in another cool thing - 
  Twitter Sentiment Analysis but so as to make it look professional & meaningful I made it end to end. 

	TWITTER ---tweets--stream----> PYTHON MACHINE LEARNING CODE---sentiment--tagged--tweets---> mySQL DB
 Hence as many times I will run it will keep accumulating results and simulataneously store in database can serve for future
 modelling as well *(I can manually tag the incorrect predictions and make model stronger)* . It can stream live tweets thanks to awesome 
 twitter api and predict sentiment of it! I had pretty good results on #flipkart #bigbillionday sale vs #amazon #greatindainsale which 
 analysed twitter sentiments of customers.
