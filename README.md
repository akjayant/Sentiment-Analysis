# Sentiment-Analysis
 	Sentiment analysis oh hackerearth predict happiness challenge 
 accuracy - 88.592% (rank 71st of 10,005 participants) pretty bad..isn't it? I think using generalised approach like stacking 
 to assign weights while doing a voting ensemble would have increased accuracy for sure. Another improvement which I 
 think will boost accuracy to upper 90s is using the ultimate text weapon - 'Sent2Vec' which is an extension of 
 'Word2Vec' to create features.
 
 	Real Time Twitter Sentiment Analysis
  So I pickled the models created by hackerearth competition and used it for making predictions in another cool thing - 
  Twitter Sentiment Analysis but I make it look professional I made it end to end. 

	TWITTER ---tweets--stream----> PYTHON MACHINE LEARNING CODE---sentiment--tagged--tweets---> mySQL DB
 Hence as many times I will run it will keep accumulating results and tweets and database can serve for future modelling as   
 well and it can stream live tweets thanks to awesome twitter api and predict sentiment of it! I had pretty good results on #flipkart 
 #bigbillionday sale vs #amazon #greatindainsale which analysed twitter sentiments of customers.
