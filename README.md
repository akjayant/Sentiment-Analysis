      *accuracy - 88.592% (rank 71st of 10,005 participants) very bad..isn't it? I think using generalised approach like stacking to               assign weights while doing a voting ensemble would have increased accuracy for sure. Another improvement which I think will boost accuracy in upper 90s is using the ultimate text weapon - 'Sent2Vec' which is an extension of 'Word2Vec' to create features.
      *Model pickling  
            So I pickled the models created by it and used it for making predictions in another cool thing - Twitter Sentiment Analysis                but I make it look professional I made it end to end i.e, Twitter -> Python -> DB 
            Hence as many times I will run it will keep accumulating results and tweets and database can serve fro future modelling as               well!
